# VH Q&A challenge

Hi! Here you can find a small Q&A Laravel application for the [VH coding challenge](https://gist.github.com/GRardB/7e2990bbea8c2e50e2b501b712d8c169).

# Installation
As any [standard laravel application](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation), with either the Docker image, or just composer.

Make sure to run the migrations before.

`php artisan migrate`

No need of running npm, Bootstrap included from the CDN.

Feel free to reach if I can clarify anything or help with something
